# üîä Audio-to-Sign-Language-Translator üëã

## üìù Description

This project provides an innovative solution to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and deaf communities by translating spoken audio into sign language visualisations. It operates in two main phases: converting the audio input to text and then mapping that text to corresponding sign language gestures, which are presented as a visual output.

The goal is to provide a real-time, accessible, and user-friendly translator.

## ‚ú® Features

* **üéôÔ∏è Audio Input:** Accepts live microphone input or pre-recorded audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.).
* **üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-Text (STT):** Utilizes **[...Specify STT Technology, e.g., OpenAI's Whisper API/Google Speech Recognition...]** for accurate transcription of spoken words.
* **üåê Sign Language Support:** Translates to **[...Specify Sign Language, e.g., American Sign Language (ASL)/Indian Sign Language (ISL)...]**.
* **üé¨ Visual Output:** Presents the signs as a sequence of **[...Specify Output Format, e.g., images/GIFs/3D avatar animation...]**.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Text Preprocessing:** Includes natural language processing (NLP) to handle complex sentences, proper grammar, and tense variations for more accurate sign mapping.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack and Dependencies

The project is built using the following technologies and libraries:

| Category | Technology/Library | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | `[Python]` | Primary programming language. |
| **Backend Framework** | `[Django]` | Used for handling web requests and serving the application. |
| **Speech Recognition** | `[`speech_recognition`, `PyAudio`...]` | For capturing audio and converting it to text. |
| **Visualisation** | `[Animation]` | For processing and displaying the sign language visuals. |
| **NLP** | `[NLTK/spaCy]` | For tokenizing and processing the transcribed text. |
| **Frontend** | `[HTML, CSS, JavaScript]` | User interface for interaction. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.7**
* **pip pytorch**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Amaan056/Audio-to-SIgn-Language-Translater.git](https://github.com/Amaan056/Audio-to-SIgn-Language-Translater.git)
    cd Audio-to-SIgn-Language-Translater
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

To run the translator application:

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is active (`source venv/bin/activate`).
2.  Execute the main application file:
    ```bash
    python [Your_Main_File].py
    ```
    *Replace `[Your_Main_File].py` with your actual entry-point file (e.g., `app.py`, `main.py`).*

3.  **Access the Application:**
    * **If a Web App:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address shown in your console).
    * **If a Desktop App:** A graphical user interface (GUI) window will pop up.

4.  **Interaction:**
    * Click the **"Record Audio"** button and speak your phrase.
    * Alternatively, upload an audio file via the **"Upload File"** option.
    * The transcribed text will appear, followed by the sign language animation.
